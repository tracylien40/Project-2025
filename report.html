<h1>Report</h1>

 <h2> Investigation </h2>

 <ul>
The brief emphasizes an importance of making datasets publicly available and accessible through interactive systems that benefit society.
My project lines up with this project brief by focusing on cryptocurrency market data , which is a relevant area that many people like myself have an interest in and can be of public economic interest.
It also addresses the needs for user-friendly tools to understand  complex cryptocurrency trends for casual users and investors like myself.
 </ul>
 <p>
Websites/Apps that are a great solution and easily understood are apps like:

CoinMarketCap
CoinMarketCap provides cryptocurrency rankings , trends in price and market cap data.
 A pro of this app is the real-time price updates , line charts for the price history that dates all the way back to a year ago and the market cap rankings.
A strength when using is , its data is wide and can be used on you mobile device.
Limitations that can be seen in this app is the lack of interactivity, for example being able to compare crypto currencies. Basic visualizations like filtering crypto.
</p>
<h1>CryptoCompare</h1>
<p>
CryptoCompare Tracks crypto prices and offers management of the portfolio.
The website contains features like historical data , comparison of multiple crypto currencies and portfolio tracking.
A strength when using this website is the easy to use interface and the tracking of the portfolio.
Limitations when using CryptoCompare is there is no advanced filtering options when you are spotting trends.
</p>
<p></p>
Glassnode 
On chain analytics (which is used to interpret and understand blockchain data) is used for investors.
In depth indicators like , active addresses , transaction volumes and wallet analysis are featured on this website.
A strength when using is there are advanced data insights for more experienced users.
Limitations about this website is , it is more complex which makes is difficult for casual users.
